Lazy SMP
===============================
    IterativeDeepening:
        synchronize smp threads (copy age, board, history, repetition list, multipv => helpers)
        depth 1 with full width window on 1 thread
        loop (depth=2 .. max)
            AspirationLoop:
                (as usual)
                start helper threads( depth, alpha, beta )
                root( depth, alpha, beta)
                stop helper threads
                (rest as usual)
            end aspiration loop
        end depth loop 
    
    starting helper threads:
        clear smp abort flag
        for each helper thread:
            copy rootmoves and minimum qs depth => helper
            signal helper to start root search at current depth (add 1 for each even helper 
            assuming 0-based indexing)  with aspiration alpha, beta bounds and wait until 
            helper starts searching 
    
    aborting helper threads:
        set abort flag for each helper and wait for each to stop searching
